## Proposed fixe for violations

The following fix is proposed: 
Ignored data found in file.

All lines before first test data section
(`ref <https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#test-data-sections>`_)
are ignored. It's recommended to add ``*** Comments ***`` section header for lines that should be ignored.

Missing section header:

    Resource   file.resource  # it looks like *** Settings *** but section header is missing - line is ignored

    *** Keywords ***
    Keyword Name
       No Operation

Comment lines that should be inside ``*** Comments ***``:

    Deprecated Test
        Keyword
        Keyword 2

    *** Test Cases ***



and 4 more violations not shown.
